        <h1 class="title">What is Human and Child Trafficking?</h1>
        <p class="statement-text">Human and child trafficking refers to the acts associated with recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for the purposes of forced labor or for personal gain. This brutal crime can take in many forms, but the common trend among them is a person, or group of people, being held against their will and forced to either work or perform sexual acts for the benefit of their captor.</p>

        <h1 class="statement-title">Brief History of Human and Child Trafficking</h1>
        <p class="statement-text">Human and child trafficking by any means is NOT a new problem. Its existence could be traced back to the olden days, all throughout medieval times, during the white slave trade in the 1400 to the 1600s, and up until the present day. It is then one of the adverse effects of globalization, as this crime appears to be increasing due to technology and the ease of travel with lower transportation costs.</p>
