          At Courageous Voices Together, our mission is to create an accessible, interactive platform dedicated to combating human trafficking and sexual abuse. We aim to demystify these issues by providing clear information, resources, and support for those in need.
          <br> <br>
          This website was developed through the collective efforts of diverse backgrounds during a virtual coding camp. This opportunity brought together three dedicated individuals from different countries, who have now created a fully functional website to fight against human trafficking and sexual abuse in their unique ways.
